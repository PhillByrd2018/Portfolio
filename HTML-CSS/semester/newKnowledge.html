        <h2>This is some of the New Knowledge I have learned this semester: </h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>Python Skills</dt>
            <dd>This semester has been my first introduction to coding and Python has been my first language. <br>
            I have learned about: for loops, while loops, lists, functions, and classes for solving problems and algorithms</dd>
            <dt>HTML/CSS</dt>
            <dd>I have gotten the chance to make my very first website. I have learned how to design and build
            dynamic and creative sites that can have many different layouts to target specific audiences.<br>
                I have become proficient in HTML and CSS page construction. </dd>
            <dt>Optimization</dt>
            <dd>I have learned to use to differential calculus to optimize functions that are representations of <br>
                revenue, cost, and profit modeling for businesses. This is really useful in helping to find the most <br>
                productive levels in a given industry with respect to multiple variables. </dd>
            <dt>Binary Conversions</dt>
            <dd>I have learned this semester what Binary is and how to do calculations with it.
                We have been learning this to understand how computers store and access
                information when it executes the code we write. It is really useful to understand binary to
                get closer to machine language. </dd>
            <dt>German Directions</dt>
            <dd>I have learned to ask and give directions in German language. This is a very useful skill when in country.
            Getting lost in a new place can be a really big problem, but if you can ask for directions in language, you won't get lost
            again.</dd>
