    <h3>This section is all about this things I have learned this year as a CIS student at CofC.</h3>
    <p>This semester has been a really busy semester. I have been mostly taking computer science related courses. <br>
    It has been a great experience and I have learned a great deal about computer programming in HTML/CSS, Python, and Javascript.<br>
    I have learned many practical things in this semester that will no doubt be useful in a career in CIS.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>My experience with Code</h3>
    <p>I really have not had any previous experience with any coding language. This semester has been expreience.
        <br>I have tackled many projects and assignments and I would estimate the number of lines of code written this semester over 1000. <br>
    I look forward to learning more languages and practicing my new learned skills.</p>
